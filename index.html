            <h2>Brief information about me</h2>
            <p>I have been working as a chief accountant for about 10 years. The profession I had chosen did not meet my expectations, and I decided to look for myself in a new. I saw an advertisement for software testing courses. I decided to try with the initial (introductory) course in order to understand for myself whether this profession is suitable for me. By the end of the course, I realized that software testing was not entirely suitable for me, as I really enjoyed working with HTML and CSS. To understand if I have a penchant for development, I decided to try myself in the Front-end. In search of further study of the profession, I learned that I still need to learn the JavaScript programming language, libraries and development tools such as Frameworks (React and Angular). I started learning JavaScript by looking for information and tasks to practice. In the course of my independent study, I came across rsschool and decided to try myself in this learning format.</p>
            <p>My motivation in all this is the desire to get moral satisfaction from my work and be proud of my achievements. I want to gain additional skills, gain new experience and improve my level of English. And in the future, get career growth.</p>
            <p>My qualities: perseverance, diligence, discipline.</p>
